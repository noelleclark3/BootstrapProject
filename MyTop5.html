				<p>Welcome to My Top 4 where I explain my top 4 favorite Taylor Swift albums and why I like them so much. I have been a die hard certified swiftie since 2009 and am in Spotify's top 0.001% of monthly Taylor Swift listeners. I can name any of her 229 songs within the first 3 seconds of listening to it. I am currently on the waitlist for tickets for her 2023 Eras Tour where I hope to be sitting front and center. And if anyone has time I would be more than happy to explain the hundreds of easter eggs in the Look What You Made Me Do music video!</p>

					<p>Taylor Swift's 8th studio album, "folklore" came out over the summer of 2020. This album wasn't originally planned and was created by her during the isolation of quarantine. This is my number one favorite Taylor Swift album. I love this album because it came out in a time of worry and uncertainty and gave me comfort and something to cling to during those times. I also love this album because it was a surprise drop, meaning she announced it and then released it that night. This album is a collection of stories that were written about fictional characters and escapsing into a fantasy world. The storytelling through the lyrics on this album is phenomenal which is what makes it one of my favorites. I also love how she just put this album out for the fans, showing us the one thing she can count on in a time of uncertainty: music. My favorite songs on this album are August, Betty, Cardigan, The Lakes, Mirrorball and My Tears Ricochet. When listening to this album, you really feel ike you've escaped into a whismical, magical forest where its just you and the light from a burning candle. </p>

					<h2 id="rep">reputation</h2>
					<p>Taylor Swift's "reputation" came out in late 2017. This was the first album she released after completely disappearing from the the spotlight for over a year. She did this because of the feud that happened between her and Kanye West. Kanye had asked Taylor about a song he was writing and if he could include the lyric "I feel like me and Taylor might still have s*x". She agreed to that specific lyric, however, she did not agree to having the lyric "I made that b*tch famous". When Taylor's team expressed that she was unhappy about that lyric, Kim Kardashian posted an edited video of their phone call on her snapchat story, making it seem like Taylor agreed to everything. Taylor then posted a statement on social media, explaining how she disapproved of the lyric and was never asked about that. That's when everyone on Twitter started calling her a snake and the hate train "#TaylorSwiftIsOverParty" was a worldwide trend. This caused her to go into hiding and write "reputation". I love this album because she took back the snake narrative and made it her own by having snakes be the theme of her new era and included a hundred foot tall blow up snake on her Reputation Stadium Tour, which broke multiple records. I could go on and on about this album and how iconic it is, all of the easter eggs, and why it is so good. My favorite songs on it are Getaway Car, Don't Blame Me, Delicate, Call It What You Want, and Dress. This album comes very close to being a tie with "folklore". </p>

					<h2 id="speak">Speak Now</h2>
					<p>"Speak Now" is my third favorite Taylor Swift album. This is the album that turned me into a die hard swiftie. This album came out in late 2010 and I remember downloading it onto my iPod and listening to it with my headphones in my room for the first time. I remember my mom yelling at my to come downstairs because we had to leave to go somewhere but I wanted to stay so I could finish the album. This album is all about growing up and the struggles and challenges that come with that. It is that magical time between your childhood and adulthood and all the experiences that come with that. I really like this album in particular because it is completely self written by Taylor. Some of her most gun-wrenching, saddest songs are on this album which really gives fans an inside look on how she naviagted her emotions at this point in her life. I also love the last track of the album, Long Live. This song finishes off the album as a thank you to her fans and all the support they've given her. Aside from Long Live, some of my other favorite songs include The Story Of Us, Back To December, Sparks Fly, and Dear John.

					<h2 id="red">Red (Taylor's Version)</h2>
					<p>My fourth favorite Taylor Swift album is "Red (Taylor's Version)". This was the second album she rerecorderd in the process of owning her master's. It was released in fall of 2021. I loved this album before she rerecorded it, but hearing her mature voice and stronger vocals sing the songs I loved in 2012 just made it even better. The album includes the 10 minute version of All Too Well, which took the world by storm last year with it's short film. This album encaptures what it feels like to get your heart broken and has so many songs on it with storytelling lyrics that you can scream at the top of your lungs. It gives the nostalgic fall vibes through the lyricism and melodies and the new vault songs on the rerecorded album make it even better. Some of my favorite songs on "Red (Taylor's Version)" are obviously the 10 minute version of All Too Well, but also Holy Ground, The Lucky One, Starlight, Treacherous, and Better Man.</p>
